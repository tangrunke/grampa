# Gaussian Random-fields Approximation for Magnetic-fields with Python Algorithms (GRAMPA)

## Overview
GRAMPA is a Python-based tool for modeling magnetic fields as Gaussian random fields following a specified power spectrum and electron density profile, as described in Murgia et al. (2004) and originally proposed by Tribble (1991). This framework is designed primarily for analyzing Faraday rotation experiments in galaxy clusters but can be applied more generally to other magnetized plasmas, depending on the chosen parameters.

## Getting Started
Install GRAMPA from PyPI with 
```
pip install grampa
```

To begin using GRAMPA, refer to the Jupyter notebook `examples/example_cluster_Bfield.ipynb`, which provides an example workflow to help users understand the implementation and features of the code.

## Developing

Pull requests are welcome for users that want to add features!

GRAMPA uses a set of developer tools that can be installed with

```
git clone git@github.com:ErikOsinga/grampa.git
cd grampa
pip install '.[dev]'
```

These tools can run upon git commit by using

`pre-commit install`

## Versioning

GRAMPA will follow the [Conventional Commit Message format:](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for versioning

- For a feature (MINOR VERSION UPDATE): (e.g. git commit -m "feat(optional scope): description")
- For a bugfix (PATCH VERSION UPDATE): (e.g. git commit -m "fix(optional scope): description")
